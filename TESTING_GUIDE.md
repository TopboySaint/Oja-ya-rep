## 🛡️ Security Notes

⚠️ **Development Only**
- These are dummy credentials for development
- Never use this system in production
- No real authentication or encryption
- Data stored in localStorage (insecure)

🔒 **For Production**
- Replace with real backend authentication
- Use JWT tokens or session cookies
- Implement proper password hashing
- Add HTTPS and CORS protection
